# get_villager_data

Scrapes https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Trading to get the villager trade information and saves the data to a file so I don't have to open the wiki 100 times a day.

* access https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Trading
* write data to file
* read data from file

## Planned Features
* command line arguments for getting only given professions
* different display options (simple, complex, full)
